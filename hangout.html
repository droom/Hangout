<h1>The Future of Smartphones? Just Add Tweezers...</h1>
<h2>A report out this week suggested that smartphones had become "the new Swiss Army Knives", which is patently ridiculous, as your iPhone does not have a tool for getting stones out of horses' hooves. But what if it did? What if it had a little pair of scissors, and a bottle opener, too?</h2>

<p>A mobile phone might currently be able to replace a notepad and a spirit level, but until they start kitting out these digital bricks with a bit of emery board on the back, they're no use to the lady with a nail-based emergency.</p>
<p>"With this in mind, and in the interests of procrastination (I have proper stuff to write), I thought it only fair to conduct my own one-man feasibility study into a genuine Swiss Army Knife/smartphone combo."</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>First of all, ask yourself if you would be happy with an iPhone that was roughly 2cm wider? Could your trouser pocket/handbag take the extra girth without suffering undue stress? "Assuming so, our proposed smartphone-come-Leatherman basically packs all of its tools in additional storage space either side of your phone." Think of your phone as you know it but now wearing a fat little rubberised jacket that is crammed full of gizmos. You still there? Good. <strong>Feasibility rating: 10</strong></p>

<h3>"Lightweight materials"</h3>
<p>Using hard but lightweight materials (we all know they're out there - don't ask me for specifics), we're looking at about five or six that could be secreted into your phone's new multi-functional sleeve. Top of the list are the aforementioned bottle opener &amp; scissors, but I'd also suggest fold-out tweezers, screwdriver, corkscrew, and bringing the concept kicking and screaming into the 21st century, a standard-issue IKEA-sized allen key.</p>
